Model C610 is the same thing but does not have noise cancelling built in (monaural design).  My experience with noise cancelling headphones is that they work very effectively at blocking consistent noise like the sound of the jet engine on an airplane or the sound of the office air conditioner.  However sounds that not consistent (like a conversation carried on by nearby co-workers) is not blocked and sometimes seems to be amplified because all the other consistent noise has been blocked.  I learned this using my Bose noise cancelling headphones.  When wearing them in the office, I could hear conversations on the other side of the office that I could not hear when taking the headphones off.  This has never been much of an issue for me wearing the Plantronics C620 headset because the speakers are small enough they fit ON you ear not OVER your ear (completely covering) like the Bose.  Because of this you can still hear some background noise even with the noise cancelling feature on."}, {"answer_text": "The headset has a stated feature of noise cancellation and in my nearly daily use I have found that to be a true claim.

It doesn't need to be tethered to a PC like other powerful VR headsets and doesn't require a phone like some mobile VR devices. It features six degrees of freedom (6DoF), meaning it can track your movements up, down, left, right, forward, and backward. It doesn't require any external sensors like the original Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Instead, it has sensors built into the headset. It also supports two updated Touch controllers, meaning it can be used to play popular gaming titles that require two hands, such as Beat Saber.    Spatial tracking from within the headset means you can move around a room-scale setup just like you can now in Rift, Vive, or Windows Mixed Reality. A camera in each corner of the headset (total of four) track space and motion controllers from the inside out. The Quest uses the same optics as the Go for a display resolution of 1,600 x 1,400 for each eye, but here you'll be able to make lens-spacing adjustments on the fly. Also, like the Go, Quest has a built-in audio system that delivers 3D sound without the need for bulky headphones. A headset jack is included if you'd like to use separate hardware, and charging is handled with a USB-C port."}]}

Eso significa que pronto (en los pr ximos meses) tendr s mucha opciones para hacer lo que quieres en el QUEST. Aunque no tenga todo ahora creo que el kit ganador es el QUEST.

If I put on my headset to go for a walk, it won't pair automatically until I get far enough away from the speaker system to drop that signal..then the phone searches and finds my headset.  The opposite happens when I return home, the phone stays connected to the headset and won't switch to the Speaker until I manually select it from my bluetooth connections menu on the phone.  I don't have to reinstall anything, just select which bluetooth device I want to use if there are ever more than one device turned on and in the room together.

We're sorry to hear this. In order to troubleshoot your earpiece, please try resetting the Bluetooth connection with your phone. To do so:  Delete the headset from your cell phone\u2019s list of paired devices. Once deleted, power your phone completely off, then power it back on. This resets the Bluetooth stack in the Bluetooth software on the phone. Re-pair the headset with your phone. You might also want to ensure the headset is the only Bluetooth device connected to your phone while you\u2019re using it in order to rule out wireless interference. You may also want to test it with a different phone to isolate the cause of the issue. If you still get linking issues, even after performing these tests, then most likely the unit has a problem and it is best to replace it.

I have a smaller head and I used to use both the logitech g930 and then the hyperX   But in all honesty if you don't have the money and only plan to use them for short sessions of gaming (about 4 hours) I would go the hyper.   I use my game one about 6-8 hours a day for gaming, music, movies, and Skype. The sound quality is amazing. But you have to hook it up to an amp unless you have a dedicated sound card. I use the game one with the astro mix amp.  So your investment in expensive headphones will not go very far if your hardware does not support it."}]}

I find them to be extremely comfortable, even if you need (or want) to wear them all day long (seriously).  I actually used my first set of Sennheiser headphones for over 5 years before purchasing this G4ME ONE set.  I needed the boom mic for playing Elite: Dangerous, and the pad that cushions the top of the head was actually beginning to disintegrate due to how much I used them.  I have to say that the Sennheiser ear cups are very spacious, comfortable, the velour-like material that covers the ear pads eliminates uncomfortable ear sweating, and they sound amazing.  My previous set of Sennheiser headphones (think they were PXC 350 model?) were more than twice what these cost, but I think the G4ME ONE set actually sounds better.  I also like the way they put the volume control in the right ear phone instead of being an inline control on the cord (those always wear out and get noisy).  I really couldn't be more pleased with them.  In another 5 years, once I literally wear these out, I'll purchase another pair of Sennheisers in this same form factor."}, {"answer_text": "My ears are big but they fit inside so there is no pressure on them."}, {"answer_text": "Old question but it is still top 5.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re using the pleather or velour pads with your ATH, but I tend to feel leather, protein leather, or pleather (plastic leather) all seem to feel harder the longer you wear them, plus they build up sweat. I personally prefer Velour by a long shot, and Sennheiser\u2019s velour is softer and not prickly/itchy like many other brands\u2019 Velour. That said, some people just feel more comfortable with Leather(ette), or like that leather(ette) is more durable/easier to clean, in which case Dekoni Audio makes the softest leatherette I\u2019ve ever felt specifically for the Game One/PC37X."}, {"answer_text": "I have a gigantic melon (size 8 fitted hats fit snug) and these are very comfortable.
