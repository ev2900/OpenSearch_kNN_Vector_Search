Model C610 is the same thing but does not have noise cancelling built in (monaural design).  My experience with noise cancelling headphones is that they work very effectively at blocking consistent noise like the sound of the jet engine on an airplane or the sound of the office air conditioner.  However sounds that not consistent (like a conversation carried on by nearby co-workers) is not blocked and sometimes seems to be amplified because all the other consistent noise has been blocked.  I learned this using my Bose noise cancelling headphones.  When wearing them in the office, I could hear conversations on the other side of the office that I could not hear when taking the headphones off.  This has never been much of an issue for me wearing the Plantronics C620 headset because the speakers are small enough they fit ON you ear not OVER your ear (completely covering) like the Bose.  Because of this you can still hear some background noise even with the noise cancelling feature on."}, {"answer_text": "The headset has a stated feature of noise cancellation and in my nearly daily use I have found that to be a true claim.

It doesn't need to be tethered to a PC like other powerful VR headsets and doesn't require a phone like some mobile VR devices. It features six degrees of freedom (6DoF), meaning it can track your movements up, down, left, right, forward, and backward. It doesn't require any external sensors like the original Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Instead, it has sensors built into the headset. It also supports two updated Touch controllers, meaning it can be used to play popular gaming titles that require two hands, such as Beat Saber.    Spatial tracking from within the headset means you can move around a room-scale setup just like you can now in Rift, Vive, or Windows Mixed Reality. A camera in each corner of the headset (total of four) track space and motion controllers from the inside out. The Quest uses the same optics as the Go for a display resolution of 1,600 x 1,400 for each eye, but here you'll be able to make lens-spacing adjustments on the fly. Also, like the Go, Quest has a built-in audio system that delivers 3D sound without the need for bulky headphones. A headset jack is included if you'd like to use separate hardware, and charging is handled with a USB-C port."}]}

Eso significa que pronto (en los pr ximos meses) tendr s mucha opciones para hacer lo que quieres en el QUEST. Aunque no tenga todo ahora creo que el kit ganador es el QUEST.

If I put on my headset to go for a walk, it won't pair automatically until I get far enough away from the speaker system to drop that signal..then the phone searches and finds my headset.  The opposite happens when I return home, the phone stays connected to the headset and won't switch to the Speaker until I manually select it from my bluetooth connections menu on the phone.  I don't have to reinstall anything, just select which bluetooth device I want to use if there are ever more than one device turned on and in the room together.

We're sorry to hear this. In order to troubleshoot your earpiece, please try resetting the Bluetooth connection with your phone. To do so:  Delete the headset from your cell phone\u2019s list of paired devices. Once deleted, power your phone completely off, then power it back on. This resets the Bluetooth stack in the Bluetooth software on the phone. Re-pair the headset with your phone. You might also want to ensure the headset is the only Bluetooth device connected to your phone while you\u2019re using it in order to rule out wireless interference. You may also want to test it with a different phone to isolate the cause of the issue. If you still get linking issues, even after performing these tests, then most likely the unit has a problem and it is best to replace it.

I use the game one with the astro mix amp.  So your investment in expensive headphones will not go very far if your hardware does not support it."}]}

I find them to be extremely comfortable, even if you need (or want) to wear them all day long (seriously).  I actually used my first set of Sennheiser headphones for over 5 years before purchasing this G4ME ONE set.  I needed the boom mic for playing Elite: Dangerous, and the pad that cushions the top of the head was actually beginning to disintegrate due to how much I used them.  I have to say that the Sennheiser ear cups are very spacious, comfortable, the velour-like material that covers the ear pads eliminates uncomfortable ear sweating, and they sound amazing.  My previous set of Sennheiser headphones (think they were PXC 350 model?) were more than twice what these cost, but I think the G4ME ONE set actually sounds better.  I also like the way they put the volume control in the right ear phone instead of being an inline control on the cord (those always wear out and get noisy).  I really couldn't be more pleased with them.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re using the pleather or velour pads with your ATH, but I tend to feel leather, protein leather, or pleather (plastic leather) all seem to feel harder the longer you wear them, plus they build up sweat. I personally prefer Velour by a long shot, and Sennheiser\u2019s velour is softer and not prickly/itchy like many other brands\u2019 Velour.

I have Astro A40's on right now and although the sound and mic quality are good (not fantastic), the ear cup padding is lacking. It's made out of a strange fabric that is mildy uncomfortable after about ten minutes. It's not horrible but it can be distracting at times. That aside however, I really like the A40. Im thinking about using these for my xbox and A40 for pc because of the mix amp and 5000 feet of chords."}, {"answer_text": "Unfortunately, the Astro A40s are about the only headset that I haven't tried. While I have heard good things about the Astros, I'd be shocked if the mic on the Astros are as good as the mic on the G4ME ONE. As far as sound quality, that is subjective, as what sound good to one person may not sound as good to another. For example some people like music that is colored by the speakers with added bass for instance. I on the other hand prefer my speakers to be extremely accurate and portray music and sound the way the artist intended for you to hear it.  That's why I went with the G4ME ONE as the sound is very accurate! In addition, as Mack Isgro alluded to in this thread, I too absolutely love the spatial stage or dimension the G4ME ONE gives you due to its open acoustic nature. I can't tell you the amount of times I've heard something and turned my head to look over my shoulder or have been freaked out by the sound I was hearing...and that's about the best compliment I can give for a headset -- that it immerses you in the music/sounds and makes you lose yourself in the world you're playing in.  So, while I can't speak for the Astros as I have not heard them, I can tell you that the G4ME ONE is a fantastic headset IMHO.  One last thing to consider though is that the G4ME ONE likes a bit of juice to sound its best. So, if you are not planning to purchase a separate amp for the G4ME ONE, you might want to consider the Astros, which I believe can be purchased as a package with an amp. Just food for thought.  Hope that helps! :)"}, {"answer_text": "Sennheiser 100%"}]}

These headphones are capable of giving really really crisp sound. so on stereo mode, you can more easily make out footsteps. So it's not bad. But I have the GSX 1000 Senheiser AMP which offers 7.1 surround sound and I think coupled with that it has the  best surround sound in gaming. It also depends on what headsets you're talking about. The ONLY HEADSETS i would say have  good surround sound \" are the Hyper X Cloud 2 and the Logitech G933. Some surround sounds may make footsteps harder to hear but these two are good alternatives. I prefer playing in surround sound on all my headsets including the Game Ones. Competitive gamers say it's better to play at stereo 2.0 so if you play stereo and agree with them, this headset will be the best stereo you can get.     My conclusion: it depends on how you perceive sound. I prefer 7.1 surround sound over Stereo for single player AND multiplayer gaming. These headphones ARE 2.0 stereo BUT if you have an MSI motherboard like the Gaming M5, you can add virtual surround sound just like any other headphones and you'll note it sounds better. Better yet, if you buy a sound blaster z sound card you can add virtual surround sound too. If money is an issue grab the Hyper X Cloud II's. You can watch reviews of it online it's an amazing headset with clear crisp sound. Best sound for gaming headset obv comes from these but because it is a 3.5mm jack connector, it depends on your hardware as well.\""}, {"answer_text": "It all depends on what you're looking for in your headset. 7.1 surround sound is good at simulating directional sound for things like videos and movies and the like, but stereo sound is much better for proper directional input, like for gaming (Tested with Rainbow Six: Siege for demonstration). Hope this helps!"}, {"answer_text": "Yes"}, {"answer_text": "Honestly, you don't really need 7.1 surround sound for gaming, stereo sounds just fine. If you have a sound card that supports 7.1 surround sound then you can just use that, but to me, it sounds really weird and distorted. I've been using these headphones for about a month now on stereo mode and I can hear every little detail in-game with crystal clarity.     However, at the end of the day, it's all about what sounds good to you. I personally think stereo sounds much better than 7.1 sound, but I suggest trying out other sound options to see what works for your ears."}]}

From a technical standpoint  side tone \" degrades audio quality as it is creating extra noise in the ear piece that is competing with the audio of the conversation so Sennheiser deliberately builds gaming headsets to not product  \"side tone \".   In a high quality headset there is a headphone signal and a mic signal that are not mixed at all and hence  \"side tone \" doesn't occur in the headset. The mixing of these signals is done at the source or console, so ultimately the Xbox 1 would be responsible for providing side-tone. To create  \"side tone \" a user would use the settings on the console to make adjustments and deliberately feed the create  \"side tone \". According to online threads, you can make this happen in the xBox settings. Hopefully this helps, and have a good afternoon\""}]}

If you are into heavy bass then it will boost the bass on the settings you set it at. I am no means an expert in sound but I tested these headsets with creative labs G5 dac and the difference is great. I can hear an enormous amount of bass pumping through the cans of these headset. The dac comes pre-configured with different modes that you can set it at, (i.e. Movie, music, witcher 3, mgsv, league of legends, and genre). In my opinion, if you want insane bass then go for the dac because it will settle nicely with these headphones. If you don't need bass then just forget about it. There are other factors to consider such as mids/highs and what not  but I'm no expert at differentiating these sounds so I base it off of my sole opinion in bass. If you do get the particular model dac I have then be wary that there are many negative experiences with this dac. I've read that the card burns out in a couple months after usage. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on long term usage since I just bought it two weeks ago. So far the dac is what I use everyday. I would recommend researching more into dac since they are pricey and run up anywhere from $100-300. Good luck!"}]}

Not really a problem for most, but I bought that stupid Nykon charger which uses BOTH front slots to charge the devices.. .   Overall, these phones are great.

That same effect is sometimes achieved through software."}, {"answer_text": "Surround sound gives you both a more immersive audio experience and more accurate positional sound. For example, when a bullet whizzes past you in a game like Battlefront you can tell which direction it came from and here it move past you. Stereo sound is still perfectly good, but once you experience surround sound it is hard to go back to stereo. Surround sound in headsets with two speaker drivers is achieved using advanced digital signal processing. It is very accurate, and sounds better and is more accurate than a typical consumer-grade multi-speaker home theater set-up. If you read some of the reviews of our new headsets that use DTS Headphone:X surround sound the writers do a good job of explaining how good it sounds. Both the Elite 800 and Stealth 500P offer DTS surround sound for the PS4. Really good surround sound requires digital audio, so the wireless transmitter connects to the optical port at the back of the PS4."}]}

I've actually used both headsets a ton and the Stealth 400 is better in the most important ways: 1- battery life. Stealth gets you about 16 hours on a charge. Gold gets you about 7 if you're lucky. 2- sound. The audio produced by the Stealth is light years ahead of what the Gold produces 3- maximum volume. Again, the Stealth produces a much louder experience if you want it 4- microphone. People have a hard time hearing me at times on the Golds. Never on the Stealth 5- build quality. Both are cheaply made, but the Golds have a design flaw that will ensure that all units break eventually. The hinges are cheap plastic that wear down every single time you fold them. If you have a pair, look at the 4 little hinges right now and I guarantee you'll see cracks forming in the middle of all 4. Once one of them breaks, you either need to get some strong tape to hold it together or buy a new pair."}, {"answer_text": "I prefer the look and feel of the turtle beach headphones.

I also wanted to get the gold headset but I got a deal with the stealth 400 at $79.99 so I couldn't pass it up and I also wanted to get the Hyper X Cloud 2 if you want just read the descriptions on all 3 headsets and see which ones you like best...
