Model C610 is the same thing but does not have noise cancelling built in (monaural design).  My experience with noise cancelling headphones is that they work very effectively at blocking consistent noise like the sound of the jet engine on an airplane or the sound of the office air conditioner.  However sounds that not consistent (like a conversation carried on by nearby co-workers) is not blocked and sometimes seems to be amplified because all the other consistent noise has been blocked.  I learned this using my Bose noise cancelling headphones.  When wearing them in the office, I could hear conversations on the other side of the office that I could not hear when taking the headphones off.  This has never been much of an issue for me wearing the Plantronics C620 headset because the speakers are small enough they fit ON you ear not OVER your ear (completely covering) like the Bose.  Because of this you can still hear some background noise even with the noise cancelling feature on."}, {"answer_text": "The headset has a stated feature of noise cancellation and in my nearly daily use I have found that to be a true claim.
