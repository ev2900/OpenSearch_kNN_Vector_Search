Model C610 is the same thing but does not have noise cancelling built in (monaural design).  My experience with noise cancelling headphones is that they work very effectively at blocking consistent noise like the sound of the jet engine on an airplane or the sound of the office air conditioner.  However sounds that not consistent (like a conversation carried on by nearby co-workers) is not blocked and sometimes seems to be amplified because all the other consistent noise has been blocked.  I learned this using my Bose noise cancelling headphones.  When wearing them in the office, I could hear conversations on the other side of the office that I could not hear when taking the headphones off.  This has never been much of an issue for me wearing the Plantronics C620 headset because the speakers are small enough they fit ON you ear not OVER your ear (completely covering) like the Bose.  Because of this you can still hear some background noise even with the noise cancelling feature on."}, {"answer_text": "The headset has a stated feature of noise cancellation and in my nearly daily use I have found that to be a true claim.

It doesn't need to be tethered to a PC like other powerful VR headsets and doesn't require a phone like some mobile VR devices. It features six degrees of freedom (6DoF), meaning it can track your movements up, down, left, right, forward, and backward. It doesn't require any external sensors like the original Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Instead, it has sensors built into the headset. It also supports two updated Touch controllers, meaning it can be used to play popular gaming titles that require two hands, such as Beat Saber.    Spatial tracking from within the headset means you can move around a room-scale setup just like you can now in Rift, Vive, or Windows Mixed Reality. A camera in each corner of the headset (total of four) track space and motion controllers from the inside out. The Quest uses the same optics as the Go for a display resolution of 1,600 x 1,400 for each eye, but here you'll be able to make lens-spacing adjustments on the fly. Also, like the Go, Quest has a built-in audio system that delivers 3D sound without the need for bulky headphones. A headset jack is included if you'd like to use separate hardware, and charging is handled with a USB-C port."}]}

Eso significa que pronto (en los pr ximos meses) tendr s mucha opciones para hacer lo que quieres en el QUEST. Aunque no tenga todo ahora creo que el kit ganador es el QUEST.
